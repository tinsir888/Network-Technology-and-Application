## Lab 2 To obtain the corresponding relationship experiment between IP address and MAC address
To obtain the corresponding relationship experiment between IP address and MAC address through programming, the requirements are as follows:
1. On the basis of the IP datagram capture and analysis programming experiment, learn the WinPcap data packet sending method.
2. Obtain the mapping relationship between IP address and MAC address through WinPcap programming.
3. The program must have the input IP address, and display the interface of the corresponding relationship between the input IP address and the obtained MAC address. The interface can be a command line interface or a graphical interface, but it should be displayed on the screen in a simple and clear way.
4. The written program should have a clear structure and good readability.
