## Lab 3 A Simple Router
The specific requirements of the simple router programming experiment are:
1. Design and implement a router program that requires the completed router program to work with existing router products (such as Cisco routers, Huawei routers, Microsoft routers, etc.).
2. The program can only realize the basic functions required by routers such as the acquisition, routing, and delivery of IP datagrams. Functions such as fragmentation processing, option processing, and dynamic routing table generation can be ignored.
3. Manual insertion and deletion methods of the routing table need to be given.
4. The work log of the router needs to be given to show the process of datagram acquisition and forwarding.
5. The completed program must pass on-site testing, and show and report in the class (or group) your own design ideas, development and implementation processes, test methods and processes.
